A single bundle in which we had combined/packed our application along with dependencies into a single unit.
A Docker container is lightweight , isolated environment that runs an application and everything it needs -- > code libraries and system tools.
- They run  irrespective of machine's operating system.

| v16  | v16  |
| ---- | ---- |
| node | node |
If we want to two applications locally on our machine , it specifies both should have same versions as of machine.

| v16  | v20  |
| ---- | ---- |
| node | node |
But using Docker we can have different versions , and our host machine can also have any different version.

- Size of Docker container  is very less as compared to the size of the virtual machine.
