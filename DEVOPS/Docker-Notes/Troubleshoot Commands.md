docker logs Cont_id
```
`docker logs` command is used to **view the output (logs) of a running or stopped container**.
```
docker logs mysql-older
```


```
docker exec -it Cont_id /bin/bash
```
`docker exec` command is one of the most powerful Docker commands because it lets you **run commands inside an already running container**.

docker exec -it mysql-older /bin/bash
