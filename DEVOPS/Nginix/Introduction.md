`Nginx`  is a high-performance web server that delivers websites, handles requests , and can also work as a reverse proxy, `load balancer` , and caching tool to manage and scale web traffic efficiently.           

It is known for its speed , stability, and low resource usage - which is why it's used by companies like Netflix ,`Github`, and `Cloudflare`.

Uses for  `Nginx`:

1. Serving static websites:
   it can directly serve HTML , CSS ,JavaScript , images , etc
2. Reverse proxy for backend apps :
   acts as a middle layer between clients ans applications like Django, node.js ,flask , etc.
3. Load balancing:
   distributes traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.
4. SSL termination:
   Handles HTTP encryption/decryption so your app server doesn't have to.
5. Caching:
   can cache dynamic content to speed up response times.
