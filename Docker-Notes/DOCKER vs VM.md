Docker  make virtual only application layer and only uses host kernel layer of that machine.
And Virtual machine make virtual  both host and application layer.

that's why docker is lightweight and small in size.

## Docker (Containers)

- **Lightweight virtual environment** for running apps.
    
- Uses the **host OS kernel** directly â€” does **not** require a full OS per container.
    
- Each container includes **only the app + dependencies**, not an entire OS.
    
- Fast to start and stop (seconds or less).
    
- Very efficient in terms of **CPU, RAM, and disk usage**.
    
- Ideal for **microservices**, development, testing, and deployment.

## Virtual Machines (VMs)

- Full virtualization of hardware using a **hypervisor** (like VirtualBox, VMware, KVM).
    
- Each VM runs a **full OS** with its own kernel.
    
- Slower to start (minutes).
    
- Uses **more resources** (RAM, CPU, disk).
    
- Great for **isolated environments**, OS testing, or running multiple OS types on a host.
    

**Example:**

- Run Windows VM on a Linux host using VirtualBox.
    
- Each VM has its own full OS, memory, and virtual hardware.


## Disadvantage of Docker

docker was initially built for linux based ditributions so to run docker on non-linux machine we use docker desktop as it uses a hypervisor layer which internally uses a lightweight linux based distribution.
